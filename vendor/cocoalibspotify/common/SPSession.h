/** This class provides core functionality for interacting with Spotify. You must have a valid, logged-in
 SPSession object before using any other part of the API.
 
 To log in and use CocoaLibSpotify, you need two things:
 
 - An application key, available at the [Spotify Developers Site](http://developer.spotify.com/).
 - A user account with the Premium subscription level.
 
Playback
 
 Please note that CocoaLibSpotify does _not_ push audio data to the system's audio
 output. To hear tracks, you need to push the raw audio data provided to your application
 as you see fit. See the SimplePlayback sample project for an example of how to do this.
